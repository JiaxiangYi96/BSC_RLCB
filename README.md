# BSC_RLCB method 
The code is used to solve structural reliability analysis problem via the BSC_RLCB method

The results on the Paper"Efficient adaptive Kriging-based reliability analysis combining new learning function and error-based stopping criterion" could be replicated by those code

Feel free to use these codes to do your own research. And don't forget to cite the paper below if you use our codes in you research.
